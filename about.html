          I am an aspiring software developer, currently enrolled in an 18-month Software Development Learnership with GirlCode, I am a passionate and driven individual with a background in Social Sciences, majoring in Psychology and Criminology. My interest in tech stems from a desire to solve real-world problems, particularly those affecting under-resourced communities like Diepsloot, where I live. Having grown up in rural areas and later moving to Diepsloot after the passing of my grandmother, I developed a strong sense of resilience and a purpose rooted in community upliftment. I am especially drawn to the intersection of technology, behavioral science, and social impact. My learning journey includes furthering my skills in data science and web development, while exploring topics such as forensic psychology. I am currently working on a community-centered project aimed at creating a digital Z83 job application platform with other group members from GirlCode. My goal is to become a versatile developer who builds inclusive, ethical, and impactful digital solutions.
